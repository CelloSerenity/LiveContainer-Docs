# 8. Will Feature X be Implemented? When will Feature X be Implemented? 
## 8.1. Behavior Modifying Features
LiveContainer's primary goal is to run apps as if they were sideloaded, without altering their intended functionality. Therefore, feature requests that modify an appâ€™s behavior (e.g., network monitoring, disabling functions) will not be considered. However, community contributions for these types of features are welcome.

## 8.2. App Crash / Malfunction Due to the Need of Entitlements Only Available to Paid Developer Account
LiveContainer is designed to somewhat bypass the 3 app limit set on free developer accounts. App crash / malfunction due to the need of entitlements only available to paid developer account (e.g., push notifications, Siri, iCloud) will not be fixed.

## 8.3. UI Beautifying / Customization Features
Requests for features like home page customization, changing app names/icons, and other visual adjustments are low priority since they are not quite useful and can potentially slow down app launch times. You can simply create a shortcut in your home screen and change how they are ordered and their name / icon.

## 8.4. Upcoming Features
The following features are likely to be added to LiveContainer.
- Install app from URL & app install URL (eta 3.3.0)
- 3+ containers for each app (eta when SideStore 0.6.0 release)
- ADP certificate support (eat when I get an ADP certificate for free)
