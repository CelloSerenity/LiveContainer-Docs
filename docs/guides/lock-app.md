# Lock & Hide Apps

LiveContainer offers three levels of app hiding:

* Lock Apps: In the app-specific settings, you can lock an app, requiring Face ID or a password to launch it.
* Hide Locked Apps: Once locked, you can hide the app. It will appear as a placeholder in the "Hidden Apps" section, and authentication is needed to view or launch it.
* Strict Hiding Mode: For complete invisibility, enable "Strict Hiding Mode" in LiveContainer's settings after authentication. Hidden apps will no longer appear in the interface. To access them, triple-tap the "x Apps in total" text on the main screen and authenticate to unlock the apps when you relaunch LiveContainer.
