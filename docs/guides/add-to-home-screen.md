# Add to Home Screen

Long press the app and you will see 2 ways to add your app to home screen:

1. Launch URL: Copy the provided URL, create a shortcut that opens the app, and add it to your home screen. Youâ€™ll need to create a separate shortcut for each app.
2. Create App Clip: Install an App Clip MDM profile, which adds the app to your home screen. Note that launching the app includes an extra jump, and the App Clip will remain in the app switcher.
