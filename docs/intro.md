# LiveContainer Introduction

An app launcher that runs iOS apps without actually installing them!

- LiveContainer is an app launcher (not emulator or hypervisor) that allows you to run iOS apps inside it.
- Allows you to install unlimited apps (3 app/10 app id free developer account limit does not apply here!), and have multiple versions of an app installed with multiple data containers.
- When JIT is available, codesign is entirely bypassed, no need to sign your apps before installing. Otherwise, app will be signed with the same certificate used by LiveContainer.
